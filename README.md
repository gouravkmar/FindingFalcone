We have to design a game where out of 6 planets we have to select 4 planets 
Out of 6 available vehicles we have to select 4 for each planet
Now with the 4 set of vehicle and planet ,  we have to call an API to check if we found the falcone.

Language used is completely swift and ui is programmatically made. no XiBs are used in this.
